# microbesim: R package for simulating microbiome relative abundance data 

Using S3 objects to implement a unified interface to simulating microbiome relative abundance data, and the ability to estimate parameters or range of parameters from real data.   

Simulation distributions  
- [ ] Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution   
- [ ] Gamma-Poisson used in ANCOM and ANCOMBC  
- [ ] Negative Binomial and Zero Inflated Negative Binomial distributions  

Simulation tasks  
- [ ] Differential Abundance  
  - [ ] Simple inflated counts in McMurdie and Holmes  
  - [ ] Compensation inflated counts in Hawinkle et al.  
  - [ ] Simple inflated means  
- [ ] Clustering  
  - Using method that allows for differential tree structures Chen et al. 2013  
- [ ] Prediction  
  - [ ] Regression  
  - [ ] Binary classification
